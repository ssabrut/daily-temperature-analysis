# Daily Temperature Analysis

This project uses time series analysis with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) in TensorFlow to study the daily temperature data of major cities around the world. The project applies LSTM to model the sequential nature of the temperature data and to capture the long-term dependencies and seasonal patterns. The project also forecasts the future temperature of a given city based on the historical data and evaluates the performance of the model.
